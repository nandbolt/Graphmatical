text = "What's a graph? Well, equations can be represented as graphs. To do this, we have two number lines, or axes, that make a cross at zero. The x-axis is horizontal, or across the landscape. The y-axis is vertical, or goes toward the sky. When you graph an equation, you essentially choose a bunch of x's as the inputs of the equation and get a bunch of y's as the outputs. This (x, y) pair corresponds to a point on the x and y axes. If you plot all of these points, you get a graph!";
