text = "Welcome to GRAPHMATICAL!, a game inspired by my previous graphing calculator game ILIAGC. However, this game is larger in scope and will have a larger emphasis on education and level creation. Whether you enjoy math, platformers or making levels, I hope you find something to enjoy here! The game is currently in development and is still in a very early and unfinished state. I'm releasing it early for feedback and testing purposes, so hopefully with each update the game will get better and better! Be aware that any changes made in this level will not persist once you leave the game. If you have any feedback or find any bugs, feel free to leave a comment on the game's page. With all that said, I hope you enjoy your time here! -nandbolt";
